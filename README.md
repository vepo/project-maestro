```properties
kafka.bootstrap.server=localhost:9092
kafka.security.protocol=SSL
kafka.ssl.truststore.location=/path/to/truststore.jks
kafka.ssl.truststore.password=yourpassword
kafka.ssl.keystore.location=/path/to/keystore.jks
kafka.ssl.keystore.password=yourpassword
kafka.ssl.key.password=yourpassword
```

### Usage
1. **Access the Web Interface**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
2. **Manage Clusters**: Use the interface to add, remove, and monitor Kafka clusters.
